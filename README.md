# K-Armed-Bandit-Problem
Code implementation of the classic K Armed Bandits problem from fundamental reinforcement learning. This includes update algorithms for both stationary and non stationary bandits

To test this out just run the main.py. 

_Feel free to play around with the hardcoded properties of the agent or the envirionment_
